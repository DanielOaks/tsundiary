<p>(for the record, we hash each password with an individual randomly-generated salt, so on that front we're A-OK. someone could walk right out the Amazon data centre on which this is hosted with all their hard drives and your passwords would still be safe.</p>

<h1>the philosophy behind tsundiary.</h1>

<h2>tsundiary will never let you know who's looking at your tsundiary.</h2>
<p>Whether directly or indirectly, it's impossible to tell how popular your journal is. We will never have "likes", comments, "follower" counts, view counts, or anything else that might let you know how many people are looking at your tsundiary.</p>
